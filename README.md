# A CLIMBER Meta-Anaylsis 2024

This code was used for the manuscript titled "Effect size discrepancies in literature versus raw datasets from experimental spinal cord injury studies: A CLIMBER meta-analysis" published in Neurotrauma Reports. 

## Description

The purpose of the study was to analyze recovery after spinal cord injury through various different behavioral outcome tests. The study compared effect sizes from literature sourced (literature-extracted data (LED)) to the literaturesâ€™ corresponding publicly available raw data (individual animal data (IAD)). Random effect models and regression analyses were applied to evaluate predictors of neuro-conversion in LED versus IAD. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

You will need to download datasets from "https://odc-sci.org/" in order to run this code. <br/> 
**Literature-Extracted Data** (LED: odc-sci:1082) -- https://dx.doi.org/10.34945/F5DG6D <br/>
**Individual Animal Data** (IAD: odc-sci:1081) -- https://dx.doi.org/10.34945/F5J59P 

### Installing

* Download the R project zip file from githib
* Add folder's to the project folder: "metagraphs_final_2024" and "data"
* After downloading the datasets from odc-sci, place the datasets into your "data" folder

### Executing program

* Once you have your datasets in your "data" folder, your code will be ready to run and the graphs will be outputted to your "metagraphs_final_2024" folder
